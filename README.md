# Taurine - Vue + Tauri + Node.js stater - Electron alternative

[Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is a framework for building tiny, blazing fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. With Node.js which you are familiar it's great alternative for [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

Node.js is packed with your server code to single binary using [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) and then run using Tauri sidecar feature.

> NOTE ⚠️
> This starter **isn't** production ready and probably won't work on every platform. Also Tauri is **not recommending** using localhost protocol that is used here. For security reasons use tauri custom protocol.
